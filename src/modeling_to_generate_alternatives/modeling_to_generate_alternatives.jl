We have implemented an updated Modeling to Generate Alternatives (MGA) Algorithm proposed by [Evelina et al., (2017)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544217304097) to generate a set of feasible, near cost-optimal technology portfolios. This algorithm was developed by [Brill Jr, E. D., 1979](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.25.5.413) and introduced to energy system planning by [DeCarolia, J. F., 2011](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140988310000721).

To create the MGA formulation, we replace the cost-minimizing objective function of GenX with a new objective function that creates multiple generation portfolios by zone. We further add a new budget constraint based on the optimal objective function value $f^*$ of the least-cost model and the user-specified value of slack $\delta$. After adding the slack constraint, the resulting MGA formulation is given as:

```math
\begin{aligned}
	\text{max/min} \quad
	&\sum_{z \in \mathcal{Z}}\sum_{r \in \mathcal{R}} \beta_{z,r}^{k}P_{z,r}\\
	\text{s.t.} \quad
	&P_{zr} = \sum_{y \in \mathcal{G}}\sum_{t \in \mathcal{T}} \omega_{t} \Theta_{y,t,z,r}  \\
	& f \leq f^* + \delta \\
	&Ax = b
\end{aligned}
```

where, $\beta_{zr}$ is a random objective fucntion coefficient betwen $[0,100]$ for MGA iteration $k$. $\Theta_{y,t,z,r}$ is a generation of technology $y$ in zone $z$ in time period $t$ that belongs to a resource type $r$. We aggregate $\Theta_{y,t,z,r}$ into a new variable $P_{z,r}$ that represents total generation from technology type $r$ in a zone $z$. In the second constraint above, $\delta$ denote the increase in budget from the least-cost solution and $f$ represents the expression for the total system cost. The constraint $Ax = b$ represents all other constraints in the power system model. We then solve the formulation with minimization and maximization objective function to explore near optimal solution space.
